# Calculator

For the UI:

I would like to use this to make it more nice.

![Calculator UI](./img/calcu.png)

I won use all the buttons and will need to simplify it.

Lets also practice with branchs on git.

So the UI came this way and is not exactly as the image before, but hey, it looks good to me right now.

Then I am going to create the functions that make things happen in the display.

### Fixing:

Big problem: it concatenates and does not evaluate
1 + 2 = 3, then if I push + X and press = 3X

In this time we are trying to addapt the function of all the program

I want to add the prints or in this case "console logs" for knowing what is happening.
There is the state of receiving the first number.
then there is the state of receiving the operator.
there is the state of receiving the second number.
there is the state of printing the calculation and prepare for new adds.

## Long numbers

You should round answers with long decimals so that they donâ€™t overflow the display.

## Equal problem
